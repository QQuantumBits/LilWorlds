# LilWorlds Changelog

## Version 1.3.1-AsyncFix - "Synchronization Fix"

**Release Date:** June 13, 2025

### üéØ **Critical Bug Fix**
- **FIXED:** `WorldBorderCenterChangeEvent may only be triggered synchronously` error
  - Fixed async world creation that was causing IllegalStateException
  - Implemented hybrid async/sync approach for optimal performance
  - World preparation (reflection, validation, logging) now runs asynchronously
  - Only the critical `creator.createWorld()` call runs synchronously (required by Bukkit API)
  - Maintains performance benefits while respecting Bukkit's threading requirements

### üöÄ **Performance Improvements**
- **NEW:** `createWorldAdvancedAsync()` method for better async handling
- **IMPROVED:** World creation now uses callback-based async pattern
- **OPTIMIZED:** Minimal main thread usage - only for world border events
- **MAINTAINED:** Legacy synchronous method for compatibility

### üîß **Technical Changes**
- Added `Consumer<Boolean>` callback pattern for async world creation
- Split world creation into async preparation and sync execution phases
- Added proper error handling for both async and sync phases
- Improved thread safety for world creation operations
